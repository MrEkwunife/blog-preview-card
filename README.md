## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Learnt about the honrizontal and vertical offset of the box-shadow css property.
Also learnt how to include a font-family that is not from the google fonts (locally downloaded font instead)

```css
.main {
  box-shadow: 10px 10px orangered;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

Focus on my css Animations

### Useful resources

- [MDN WebDocs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me understand how the box-shadow property works
- [Google](https://www.google.com) - Googled some forgotten synthaxes
